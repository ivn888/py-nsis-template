Python NSIS template
====================

This is a template for an [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) installer for a Python
application. It bundles a copy of the Python interpreter, so you can make an installer
to share with people who don't have Python installed.

Using NSIS, it's also possible to make Windows installers from a Linux or Mac machine.

This uses bits cribbed from the NSIS wiki page [Embedding other installers](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Embedding_other_installers).
